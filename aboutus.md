# Introducing the MESS

The Madrid Empirical Social Sciences (MESS) is a collaborative platform aimed at fostering the exchange between social scientists from various academic institutions across Madrid. Membership is open to all faculty members, researchers, and professionals with an interest in social sciences in Madrid. Our main activities center around an annual workshop that provides an opportunity to present research projects and exchange ideas, as well as regular get-togethers to help build networks between colleagues from different institutions.

The MESS has more than 85 members from various academic institutions in Madrid including [Carlos III University](https://www.uc3m.es/Home), [IE University](https://www.ie.edu/), the [Institute of Public Goods and Policies (CSIC)](https://ipp.csic.es/en), [Complutense University](https://www.ucm.es/english), [CUNEF University](https://www.cunef.edu/en/), [Universidad Autónoma de Madrid](https://www.uam.es/uam/en/inicio), and others.

We believe that MESS has the potential to elevate the quality of social science research and contribute to the vibrant academic landscape in our city. Your involvement will be invaluable to the success of this initiative and to the success of our annual workshop. Should you have any questions or require more information, please do not hesitate to contact us.
