The MESS Inaugural Workshop is approaching and we are looking at an amazing lineup of presentations! Here is the latest version of our [Workshop Program](/assets/img/MESS-Program.pdf) along with additional information for presenters and discussants.

To help with the organization and ensure the best experience for everyone, **please register** and provide your food preferences for the workshop using this [link](https://forms.gle/aMUCDEHGLh1hD4cWA).

We kindly ask everyone to register who is planning to attend, whether as a presenter, discussant, or regular attendee. Presenting a poster or paper is not a requirement for attendance, **everyone is welcome to join**!

As part of the registration form, you can also indicate whether you would like to **volunteer as a discussant** for one of the panels. We appreciate your support!
