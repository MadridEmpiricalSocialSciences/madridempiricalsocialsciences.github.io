We are excited about the second installment of our annual MESS conference on October 24-25 at IE University! We have an exceptional line-up of presentations, and we canâ€™t wait to see everyone. Here is the [conference program](/assets/img/MESS2025-Program.pdf) along with additional information for presenters and discussants. All members of the MESS community are invited to attend the conference (i.e., presenting or discussing is not required to join). You can find additional information about the workshop including on how to sign up as a regular attendee [here](https://madridempiricalsocialsciences.github.io/mess2025/).
