We are excited to introduce you to a new initiative to connect social science researchers in Madrid. We cordially invite you to become part of the Madrid Empirical Social Science (MESS) network, a collaborative platform aimed at fostering the exchange between social scientists from various academic institutions across Madrid. Our main activity will center around an annual workshop that provides an opportunity to present research projects, exchange ideas, and network with colleagues from different institutions.

To join the MESS and learn more about our inaugural annual workshop at the Puerta de Toledo Campus, simply reply to this email. We have contacted two people from a non-exhaustive selection of departments and institutions, but we invite you to spread the word --membership should be open to all faculty members, researchers, and professionals with an interest in social sciences in Madrid.

We believe that MESS has the potential to elevate the quality of research in social sciences and contribute to the vibrant academic landscape in our city. Your involvement will be invaluable to the success of this initiative and to the success of our annual workshop. Should you have any questions or require more information, please do not hesitate to contact us. Our plan is to organize an online meeting with whoever is interested in engaging in this initiative to start building a structure and organizing our inaugural workshop.

Thank you for considering our invitation. We look forward to welcoming you into the MESS community!

Sincerely,

The MESS Committee
